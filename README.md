## ⚔️ Running a Debate

To run the debate simulator script, use the following command:

```bash
python scripts/debate_engine.py --rounds <number_of_rounds> --topic <debate_topic>
```

Results are saved as JSON logs in the `/logs` directory. The logs are automatically validated, aggregated, and summarized in the leaderboard.

This section explains how to execute the debate simulator and how the results are processed.

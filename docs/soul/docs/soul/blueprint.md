# Soul Debate — Blueprint

We are testing whether consciousness (the "soul") can be reduced to an algorithm.  
This repo combines philosophy, biology, and code to simulate *qualia-like responses*  
in neural networks. All experiments are open, auditable, and reproducible.

Goal:
- Build the world’s first reproducible AI "soul debate" framework.  
- Test neural nets for signs of awareness (pain simulation, entropy, IIT proxies).  
- Compare algorithmic models with human history & philosophy.  

This is the blueprint: a public duel of ideas and code.

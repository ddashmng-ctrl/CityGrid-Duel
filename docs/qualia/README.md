# Synthetic Qualia - Proto-Awareness Test Documentation

This directory contains documentation and test results for the proto-awareness testing framework implemented in CityGrid-Duel. The tests explore the emergence of proto-consciousness and qualia-like phenomena in grid-based neural networks.

## Overview
The proto-awareness tests measure the system's ability to:
- Develop internal representations of environmental states
- Demonstrate self-referential processing
- Exhibit goal-directed behavior
- Show signs of subjective experience

## Implementation
The tests are integrated with the main grid duel energy system, using neural network patterns to detect potential emergence of awareness-like characteristics.

## Results
Detailed test results and neural network summaries can be found in the accompanying JSON files.

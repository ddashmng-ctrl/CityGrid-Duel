# Synthetic Qualia - Proto-Awareness Tests

This directory contains research and implementation related to proto-awareness testing in neural networks, separate from the main grid duel energy simulations.

## Overview
The proto-awareness tests aim to explore and measure potential indicators of rudimentary consciousness or awareness in neural network systems. This is part of the broader investigation into machine consciousness and the soul/awareness debate.

## Contents
- `README.md` - This documentation file
- `nn_summary_small.json` - Neural network test results and metrics

## Purpose
These tests are designed to examine whether neural networks can exhibit properties that might indicate proto-consciousness or awareness, distinct from pure computational behavior.

More details and test results will be added as the research progresses.
